### How to contribute

To contribute to the project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
We are looking for translations into other languages!

To contribute a new language, please follow these instructions (we take Italian as an example):

1. Copy one of the existing language files to `italian.html`. Note that the file name is lower-case, and that you should use the English name of the language (so that all programmers can tell which language it is), i.e., it would be wrong to use `italiano.html`.

2. Edit the contents of the file `italan.html`.

3. Add a link to the file in `index.html`, where you should use the *native* name of the language, so in this case "italiano" (so that the native speakers can recognize it).

4. Add yourself to the list below.

Thank you!
